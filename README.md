MeLoPPR
=============================================

This repository is the implementation of the paper MELOPPR: Software/Hardware Co-design for Memory-efficientLow-latency Personalized PageRank published at DAC'21.
The paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09616)

----------------

Prerequisites
------------------
- Python3 preferred
- Networkx package

------------------

Datasets:
-------------

MeLoPPR is tested on six graphs: _citeseer_, _cora_, _pubmed_, _dblp_, _amazon_, and _youtube_.

This repository contains the first three, and you may download the others from [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/)

------------------

Code description
-------------------------
- **equation_validation.py**: validates the stage decomposition and linear decomposition equations
- **toy_example.py**: validates the algorithm on the citeseer graph
- **PPR.py**: include the optimizations discussed in the paper (with memory and CPU time measuring code commented)

------------------
